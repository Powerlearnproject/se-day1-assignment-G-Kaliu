#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of developig,designing, testing and maintainig software applications.

Importance of Software Engineering
a. User Experience: Software engineering plays a crucial role in making products user-friendly and accessible.A focus on usability and design ensures that technology can be easily adopted by people across various skill levels.
b.Cost Efficiency: A well-engineered software solution can reduce operational costs and increase productivity.
c.Innovation: Software engineering drives innovation in various industries, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and automation. 
d.Scalability: As technology evolves, businesses need software that can handle increasing loads and adapt to new demands. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a.The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) - The NATO Conference
-This milestone emphasized the need for structured approaches, formal methodologies, and best practices in software development.
b.The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s)
-Traditional procedural programming (e.g., C, Pascal) made it difficult to manage large, complex software systems.
-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) emerged, with languages like Smalltalk, C++, and later Java, promoting modular, reusable, and scalable code.
c.The Agile Revolution (2001 - Present)
-Agile is a dominant software development approach, helping teams quickly adapt to changing requirements and deliver continuous improvements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a.Planning:Defines project goals, scope, resources, timeline, and budget.Identifies potential risks and feasibility of the project.
b.Requirement Analysis:Gathers and documents user and system requirements.Ensures all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what needs to be built.
c.Design:Creates architectural blueprints, system models, and UI/UX designs.Defines database structures, software components, and technology stack.
d.Implementation(coding):Developers write and integrate code based on the design specifications.The core functionality of the software is built in this phase.
e.Testing:Conducts unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT).Identifies and fixes bugs to ensure software quality and reliability.
f.Deployment:Releases the software for users (can be phased or full deployment).May involve cloud deployment, on-premise installation, or mobile app publishing.
g.Maintenance & Support:Provides updates, bug fixes, and improvements based on user feedback.Ensures long-term performance, security, and scalability.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is best for structured, high-stability projects, while Agile excels in fast-paced, evolving environments requiring flexibility.
Waterfall Example:Developing a banking system where security and compliance are critical.
Reason: Banking applications require detailed documentation, strict regulations, and well-defined requirements that should not change frequently.

Agile Example:Building a mobile app startup that needs to launch quickly and adapt to user feedback.
Reason:Agile allows for frequent iterations, continuous improvements, and adapting to customer needs, ensuring a faster go-to-market.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a.A Software Developer is responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining code to build functional software applications.
Key Responsibility
-Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code based on requirements.
-Debugging and fixing issues in the software.
-Collaborating with designers, product managers, and other developers.
-Implementing new features and updating existing ones.
-Writing documentation for code and APIs.
-Staying up-to-date with new technologies and best practices.

b.Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
A QA Engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards by identifying bugs and improving performance before release.
Key Responsibility
-A QA Engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards by identifying bugs and improving performance before release.
-Performing manual and automated testing to find defects.
-Reporting and tracking bugs using tools like JIRA.
-Ensuring software meets security, usability, and performance standards.
-Working with developers to improve code quality.
-Continuously enhancing testing processes and automation frameworks

c.Project Manager (PM)
A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects, ensuring they meet deadlines and requirements.
Key Responsibility
-Defining project scope, goals, and timelines.
-Assigning tasks to developers, designers, and QA engineers.
-Managing risks and resolving roadblocks.
-Communicating with stakeholders and keeping them updated.
-Ensuring the project stays within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is a software application that provides tools to streamline coding, debugging, and testing, making development more efficient.Example:Visual Studio Code (VS Code),IntelliJ IDEA,Eclipse
Importance of IDE
- Offers features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and code refactoring.
- Supports plugins for databases, version control, and frameworks.

A VCS helps developers track changes in code, collaborate efficiently, and maintain a history of modifications.Example:Git,GitHub,GitLab
Importance of VCS
-Multiple developers can work on the same project without conflicts.
-Maintains a record of all changes, allowing rollbacks if needed.
-Prevents data loss by storing versions remotely.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenge:Some bugs are difficult to identify and may only appear under specific conditions.
Strategies to overcome:Use debugging tools like GDB, Chrome DevTools, or VS Code Debugger.

Challenge:Stakeholders may frequently change project requirements.
Strategies to overcome:Use Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban) for flexibility.

Challenge:Older codebases may lack proper documentation and use outdated practices.
Strategies to overcome:Use version control (Git) and backups to prevent data loss.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing tests individual components or functions of a program in isolation.
Importance
-Catches bugs early in development.
-Ensures each function works as expected before integration.
-Simplifies debugging by isolating issues in specific code units.

Intergration testing tests interactions between multiple components or modules.
Importance
-Detects issues in data flow and communication between modules.
-Prevents failures caused by incompatible components.

System testing tests the complete application to verify it meets functional and non-functional requirements.
Importance
-Ensures that the entire system functions correctly as a whole.
-Helps identify performance, security, and usability issues.

Acceptance testing is the final testing phase to determine if the software meets business requirements.
Importance
-Confirms that the software is ready for real-world use.
-Reduces the risk of dissatisfaction and costly fixes after launch.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting and refining text-based inputs (prompts) to effectively communicate with AI models, such as ChatGPT, to achieve optimal responses.
Importance of propmt engineering
a.Enhances AI Response Quality:Well-designed prompts lead to more precise and relevant answers.
b.Improves Productivity & Efficiency:Helps users get the desired output faster.
c.Customizes AI Behavior:Allows users to set context, tone, and style in responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about technology."

Problem:
Too broad and unspecific.
The AI doesn’t know which aspect of technology to focus on (history, trends, impact, a specific field, etc.).
Results in a generic, unfocused response.

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on the healthcare industry, including its benefits, challenges, and real-world applications."

Why is this prompt more effective?
✔ Clear & Specific – It specifies AI in healthcare rather than just "technology."
✔ Concise – The request is direct and easy to understand.
✔ Contextual – It asks for impact, benefits, challenges, and real-world applications, guiding the AI to provide a structured response.
